### Project Description: Verifiable Work Identity

This project implements a blockchain-based **Decentralized Credentials System** that allows users to request and issue credentials (e.g., work experience, education, certifications). It uses smart contracts to store and manage credentials securely and transparently. Users pay a fee to request credentials, which is transferred to the issuer upon approval. The system ensures tamper-proof storage of credentials and supports a decentralized identity verification process.

### Key Features:

- Request and issue credentials securely on-chain.
- Fee-based system where issuers are compensated for validating credentials.
- Transparent credential storage.
